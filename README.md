# UCSDGraphCourseProject
This Repository conatins a Java GUI based Google Maps API Application,which is the project for the coursera course for "Advanced Data Structures in Java" offered UC Sandiego.The link for the coursera course is https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures/home/welcome. 
After Running this java application a GUI is launced from whcih the user can be able to look at the shortest distance from one point to another in the test map provided in the GUI,which uses graph traversal algortihms like A* search,Depth first Traversal,Bread First Traversal,Dijkstra
Graph Traversal Algorithm.
The users can verify the working of each algorihm by looking at near by intersections discovered by the graph algorithm at runtime,thus can analyze how each algorithm works.

Note:
currently this project is yet to be implemented completly and work is in progress for A* search and Dijkstra Graph Traversal algorithm.
